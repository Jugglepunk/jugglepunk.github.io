                  This piece attempts to convey how I feel at family gatherings where they say grace. The pressure to stand for the pledge of allegiance. To join family at church every Sunday. When Mormon missionary girls corner you and ask, “do you believe in god?” It speaks of an unquestioned majority. The feeling of wanting to be respectful but still being pulled right into the middle of a tradition that you don’t want to be a part of. The feeling of alienation while still being forced to participate. The feeling of fear, not wanting to upset people important to you. The imposing figures represent family, teachers, coaches, and missionaries. The people quietly forcing beliefs while you just respectfully follow along. This piece is based on a small card given out by Mormon campus missionaries. I was handed the card after two of them cornered me on campus and not before we had a pleasant but uncomfortable conversation.

                “Where are you?” This is the phrase we were given as part of our project prompt. I have taken this question and turned it around to say, “where is me?” The word “location” can be used literally, or in a more abstract sense. I am using location to talk about where my true self is. I think that the true self is deep inside us. It is inexpressible and trapped unseen forever. Parts of it can shine through but nobody will ever see us in our truest form. To represent this in sculpture I have used white tissue paper and created layered spheres that encapsulate a light bulb. When viewed you can see the light emanating from the center, but you cannot see the light source.

         <p><em>Platos_Book</em></p>

                <img src="images/PlatosBook.jpeg" alt="<!--Image-->" id="port">
                Plato’s Allegory depicts the transition from the cave where the only light is a small campfire to the surface where the sun shines down. A triangle is the simplest representation of fire. I took that fire and rotated it until it formed a circle, the simplest representation of the Sun. While the viewer “reads” through the book, they recreate the journey from the cave to the open air. This piece is meant to be interacted with.

                This project started off looking at Richard Serra’s Verb List and trying to apply these verbs to physical forms. While looking over lists of verbs I became interested in the verbs that don’t seem like they can be applied to objects, the ones that are more human. I created three sets of two forms, each having several verbs applied to them. The list of verbs used include: love, assure, protect, and depend. Each of the forms is 3D printed and they were created on a standard measurement, therefore they can be used in other configurations to represent more verbs.

                Influenced by the book Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Ray. This object is an attempt to make a "well designed" mouse. By adding the impression of a handprint I try to intrface the digital with the organic. This bject started out as a clay inprint of my hand, then 3D scanned and printed.

            Using my mouse to mimic the steps of Bruce Nauman's "Square Dance" I reproduce his idea of moving within his studio space while moving within my own studio space, my laptop.
