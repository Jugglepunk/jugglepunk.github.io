            This project started off looking at Richard Serra’s Verb List and trying to apply these verbs to physical forms. While looking over lists of verbs I became interested in the verbs that don’t seem like they can be applied to objects, the ones that are more human. I created three sets of two forms, each having several verbs applied to them. The list of verbs used include: love, assure, protect, and depend. Each of the forms is 3D printed and they were created on a standard measurement, therefore they can be used in other configurations to represent more verbs.
